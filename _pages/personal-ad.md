I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science. My research interests are reinforcement learning and meta-learning. I have a background in interpretable (supervised) machine learning. I have also had prior experience applying  machine learning methods from computer vision and natural language processing to real-world problems. 

I would be interested in exploring the following:

- Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning
- Evolutionary computation (various topics) 
- Lifelong reinforcement learning

Please email me at caroline.l.wang@utexas.edu if you're interested in collaborating! I haven't teamed up with anybody yet.
