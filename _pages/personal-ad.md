I'm a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science. My research interests are reinforcement learning and meta-learning. I have a background in interpretable/fair (supervised) machine learning, and have prior experience applying  machine learning methods (computer vision, natural language processing, ensembling methods) to diverse real-world problems. 

I would be interested in exploring the following:

1) Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning
2) Evolutionary computation (various topics) 
3) Lifelong reinforcement learning

You can reach me at caroline.l.wang@utexas.edu if you're interested in collaborating on a project. I haven't teamed up with anybody yet.
