I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at UT Austin, supervised by Prof. Peter Stone. I am fortunate to be a current student researcher at Google DeepMind in Montreal, and to have previously interned at Sony AI. 

I am interested in how artificial agents might learn to coordinate with unseen agents---a problem known as ad hoc teamwork. My other research interests include decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, leveraging demonstration knowledge to improve sample efficiency of reinforcement learning, and representation learning for reinforcement learning. 

I received a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Duke University, where I researched interpretable machine learning methods for criminal recidivism prediction with Prof. Cynthia Rudin. We also analyzed the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm, showing that a nonlinear dependence on age was an alternative explanation for the previously observed racial bias of COMPAS. My work was recognized with a Goldwater Scholarship, a premier national undergraduate research award.
