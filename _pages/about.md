I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at UT Austin, supervised by Prof. Peter Stone. I am fortunate to be a current student researcher at Google DeepMind in Montreal, and to have previously interned at Sony AI. 
My PhD research is focused on understanding cooperative dynamics in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings and on designing algorithms to enable artificial agents to coordinate with previously unseen agents such as humans---a problem known as ad hoc teamwork. 

My work in multi-agent reinforcement learning is grounded by a broad set of general research interests. In no particular order, I'm interested in:

- Understanding the principles of learning for both individuals and groups of agents, especially those necessary for cooperation, and those that result in emergent abilities in rich multi-agent systems.
- Understanding necessary and sufficient conditions for generalist agents that operate within a rich, multi-agent world, rather than superhuman single-task solvers. 

As such, in addition to MARL and AHT, I'm interested in generalization, continual learning, and social learning.

My other research interests include decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, leveraging demonstration knowledge to improve sample efficiency of reinforcement learning, and representation learning for reinforcement learning.  -->

I received a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Duke University, where I researched interpretable machine learning methods for criminal recidivism prediction with Prof. Cynthia Rudin. We also analyzed the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm, showing that a nonlinear dependence on age was an alternative explanation for the previously observed racial bias of COMPAS. My work was recognized with a Goldwater Scholarship, a premier national undergraduate research award.
