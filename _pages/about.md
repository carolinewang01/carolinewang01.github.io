I'm currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student at UT Austin, supervised by Prof. Peter Stone. My research interests are decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, and leveraging demonstration knowledge to improve sample efficiency of reinforcement learning.


I received a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Duke University, where I researched interpretable machine learning methods for criminal recidivism prediction with Prof. Cynthia Rudin. We also analyzed the COMPAS recidivism prediction algorithm, showing that a nonlinear dependence on age was an alternative explanation for the previously observed racial bias of COMPAS. My work was recognized with a Goldwater Scholarship, a national-level undergraduate research award.
