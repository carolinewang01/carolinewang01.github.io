I'm currently a Ph.D. student at UT Austin in the Department of Computer Science. My current research interests are combining reinforcement learning and imitation learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.


Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Duke University, where I researched interpretable machine learning for criminal recidivism with Dr. Cynthia Rudin in the Prediction Analysis Lab. I also worked on applying machine learning methods from computer vision and natural language processing to real-world problems.
