I'm currently Ph.D. student at UT Austin. My research interests are reinforcement learning and meta-learning. 

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Duke University, where I researched interpretable machine learning for criminal recidivism with Dr. Cynthia Rudin in the Prediction Analysis Lab.
