Better insight extraction from traffic data can aid the effort to understand/reduce air pollution, and allow dynamic traffic flow optimization. Currently, traffic statistics (counts of vehicle types, stops, and starts) are obtained through high-cost manual labor (i.e. individuals counting vehicles by the road) and are extrapolated to annual averages. Furthermore, they are not detailed enough to evaluate traffic/air pollution initiatives.

The purpose of the project is to create an open-source library to automate the collection of live traffic video data, and extract descriptive statistics (counts, stops, and starts by vehicle type) using computer vision techniques. With this library, project partners will be able to input traffic camera videos, and obtain real-time traffic statistics which are localized to the level of individual streets.

See the technical report and readme on the [Github](https://github.com/dssg/air_pollution_estimation) for more details.
